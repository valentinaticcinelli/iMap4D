# iMap4D
A toolbox for the analysis of Virtual Reality eye-tracking data, with creation of 4D fixation maps and statistical analysis

This toolbox is thought as an extension of iMap4. An extensive guidebook for iMap4D is still in preparation, however the guide for iMap$ still apply in large measure.

This version is a beta. Major work will follow to make it 100% stabile, and to finally make it suitable to investigate time-variable stimuli. Which is of course the main advantage carried by Virtual Reality experiments.

To start the toolbox's interface, simply run the file iMAP4D.m
